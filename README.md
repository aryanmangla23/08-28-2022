Woke up at 7. Made breakfast tea. Worked on Japanese for an hour. Showered. 

Went to the library. Finishing Japanese. Met priscilla at library. Finished working on Japanese. Saw priscilla's mom and and Andrea.

Vivian came in around 10-11. Soohyuk came later like 12-1. Joseph Zou came like 2-3. Gordon like 3-4. Sarah, Daniel, and Isabella came in around like 2 as well. Very interesting day.

Hmm. I am so confused lol. Ryan knows wat I am talking about. ðŸ‘‹ hi ryan. I am even more confused after today. interesting.

Never talked about it and won't talk about it:

**Clomp. Clomp. My eyes set towards the blue sky. As the noises grow closer and closer, my gaze falls further and further down till my shoes are in sight. Iâ€™m not ready. My legs start shaking and anxiety floods in. Clomp. Clomp. As the footsteps fade away from me, I lie still on the bleachers with the only thing in sight, the once blue sky is now cloudy. Mirroring my mind. Sadness. Rejection. Uncertainty. I lost my closest friend, and I want to set things right. What do I do now?**

I sometimes have the urge to be front up and just tell you to stfu. Something very ironic I saw. Hmm. LOL IM SO CONFUSED :D:D:D:D guysh guyhsa sakfasa aa;ms;a;a;a;;ma;;m;am;aaa. kay time to cope scrww this. Why can't people stop acting weird m8.
